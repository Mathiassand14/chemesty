# Chemesty Project Boards Setup Guide

This directory contains templates and configurations for setting up GitHub Project Boards to track progress across different aspects of the Chemesty project.

## Available Project Board Templates

### 1. Bug Tracking Board (`bug-tracking-board.yml`)

**Purpose**: Track and manage bug reports and fixes

**Key Features**:
- **Status Tracking**: New → Triaged → In Progress → Testing → Done
- **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Component Categories**: Elements, Molecules, Database, Quantum, Visualization, CLI, Documentation, Infrastructure
- **Multiple Views**: All Bugs, Active Bugs, By Priority

**Best Practices**:
- Triage new bugs within 48 hours
- Assign priority based on impact and urgency
- Use component labels to route bugs to appropriate team members
- Move bugs to "Testing" when fixes are ready for verification

### 2. Feature Development Board (`feature-development-board.yml`)

**Purpose**: Track feature requests and development progress

**Key Features**:
- **Development Pipeline**: Proposed → Approved → In Design → In Development → In Review → Testing → Done
- **Size Estimates**: XS (1-2 days) to XL (1+ months)
- **Categories**: Core Chemistry, Quantum Chemistry, Visualization, Database, ML, UI, Performance, Integration
- **Priority Framework**: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have (MoSCoW method)

**Best Practices**:
- Review and approve feature requests before development starts
- Estimate feature size during planning phase
- Use category labels to organize work by domain
- Prioritize features based on release goals

### 3. Release Management Board (`release-management-board.yml`)

**Purpose**: Track release planning, milestones, and deployment progress

**Key Features**:
- **Release Pipeline**: Planning → In Progress → Feature Freeze → Testing → Ready → Released
- **Release Types**: Major, Minor, Patch, Hotfix (following semantic versioning)
- **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Normal, Low
- **Environment Tracking**: Development, Staging, Production

**Best Practices**:
- Plan releases with clear scope and timeline
- Enforce feature freeze before testing phase
- Test releases thoroughly in staging before production
- Document release notes and changelog updates

## Setting Up Project Boards

### Step 1: Create a New Project Board

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose "Board" or "Table" layout
5. Give your project a descriptive name

### Step 2: Configure Fields and Views

Use the YAML templates provided to configure:

1. **Custom Fields**: Copy field definitions from the template files
2. **Views**: Set up different views for various workflows
3. **Automation**: Configure automatic status updates based on issue/PR events

### Step 3: Link Issues and Pull Requests

- Link relevant issues and pull requests to project items
- Use GitHub's automation to move items between columns
- Set up rules for automatic status updates

## Workflow Integration

### Bug Workflow

```
Bug Report → Triage → Assignment → Development → Testing → Closure
     ↓           ↓          ↓            ↓          ↓        ↓
   New      Triaged   In Progress    Testing     Done   Closed
```

### Feature Workflow

```
Feature Request → Review → Design → Development → Review → Testing → Release
       ↓            ↓        ↓          ↓          ↓        ↓        ↓
   Proposed     Approved  In Design  In Development  In Review  Testing  Done
```

### Release Workflow

```
Release Planning → Development → Feature Freeze → Testing → Deployment
       ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓          ↓
   Planning      In Progress   Feature Freeze   Testing    Ready
```

## Automation Rules

### Recommended Automations

1. **Issue Creation**: Automatically add new issues to "Bug Tracking" board with "New" status
2. **PR Creation**: Add new PRs to "Feature Development" board with "In Review" status
3. **PR Merge**: Move items to "Done" when PRs are merged
4. **Issue Closure**: Archive items when issues are closed

### GitHub Actions Integration

Create workflows that update project boards based on:
- Issue labels and milestones
- PR status changes
- Release events
- Test results

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines

1. **Consistent Labeling**: Use consistent labels across issues and PRs
2. **Regular Updates**: Update project boards during daily standups
3. **Clear Ownership**: Assign items to specific team members
4. **Milestone Tracking**: Link items to appropriate milestones

### Team Collaboration

1. **Daily Standups**: Review active items in each board
2. **Sprint Planning**: Use boards to plan upcoming work
3. **Retrospectives**: Analyze completed items for process improvements
4. **Release Planning**: Use release board for milestone planning

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive completed items periodically
2. **Template Updates**: Update templates as processes evolve
3. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor cycle times and completion rates
4. **Process Refinement**: Adjust workflows based on team feedback

## Customization

### Adding Custom Fields

To add project-specific fields:

1. Edit the appropriate YAML template
2. Add new field definitions under the `fields` section
3. Update views to include new fields
4. Test the configuration before applying to production boards

### Creating New Board Types

For specialized workflows:

1. Copy an existing template as a starting point
2. Modify fields and statuses for your specific needs
3. Create appropriate views and filters
4. Document the new workflow in this README

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Items Not Moving**: Check automation rules and permissions
2. **Missing Fields**: Verify field configurations match templates
3. **View Filters**: Ensure filter syntax is correct
4. **Permissions**: Confirm team members have appropriate access

### Getting Help

- Check GitHub's Project Board documentation
- Review existing project configurations
- Ask in team discussions or issues
- Contact project maintainers for assistance
