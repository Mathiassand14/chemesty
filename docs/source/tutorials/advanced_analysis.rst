Step 1: Statistical Analysis of Chemical Data
--------------------------------------------

Learn how to apply statistical methods to chemical datasets.

Basic Statistical Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from chemesty.molecules.molecule import Molecule
   import statistics
   
   # Analyze molecular weight distribution
   molecules = [
       "H2O", "CH4", "CO2", "NH3", "C2H6", "C2H4", "C2H2",
       "C6H6", "C6H12O6", "C8H10N4O2", "C9H8O4"
   ]
   
   molecular_weights = []
   for formula in molecules:
       mol = Molecule(formula=formula)
       molecular_weights.append(mol.molecular_weight())
   
   print("Molecular Weight Analysis:")
   print(f"Mean: {statistics.mean(molecular_weights):.2f} g/mol")
   print(f"Median: {statistics.median(molecular_weights):.2f} g/mol")
   print(f"Standard deviation: {statistics.stdev(molecular_weights):.2f} g/mol")
   print(f"Range: {min(molecular_weights):.2f} - {max(molecular_weights):.2f} g/mol")
