Utils Module
===========

This module provides utility functions and classes used throughout the Chemesty package. It contains common functionality that is shared across different modules, helping to reduce code duplication and ensure consistency.

Key Features
-----------

* Common mathematical operations for chemistry calculations
* Unit conversion utilities
* String formatting and parsing for chemical formulas
* Error handling and validation functions
* Logging and debugging utilities

Note
----

The utils module is designed to be lightweight and focused on general-purpose functionality. Module-specific utilities are typically included in their respective modules rather than in the central utils module.

Future Development
----------------

Future versions of the utils module will include:

* More comprehensive unit conversion functions
* Additional mathematical utilities for complex calculations
* Improved formula parsing with support for more notation styles
* Performance optimizations for frequently used functions
